(December 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nTime management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities—especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency and productivity.[1]\\nTime management involves demands relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests and commitments. Using time effectively gives people more choices in managing activities.[2] Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools and techniques, especially when accomplishing specific tasks, projects and goals complying with a due date.[3]\\n\\n\\nCultural views[edit]\\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a linear time view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America and most Northern European countries, such as Germany, Switzerland and England.[4] People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time.[4] This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more \"monochronic\", or preferring to do only one thing at a time. As a result, this focus on efficiency often leads to a culture of punctuality and a strong emphasis on meeting deadlines.[5]\\nAnother cultural time view is the multi-active time view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the better. This creates a sense of happiness.[4] Multi-active cultures are \"polychronic\" or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy.[4] In these cultures, people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations.[4] In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last and instead focus on having high-quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.[6]\\nA final cultural time view is a cyclical time view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence there is an unlimited amount of it.[4] This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia, including Japan and China. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to focus on completing tasks correctly, thus most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have, before acting on their plans.[6] Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage.[7] Consequently, this awareness often leads to a greater emphasis on relationships and the quality of interactions over strict adherence to schedules.[8]\\n\\nNeuropsychology[edit]\\nExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[9] Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.[10]\\n\\nMethods[edit]\\nTask list organization[edit]\\nTask lists are often prioritized in the following ways:\\n\\nA daily list of things to do, numbered in the order of their importance and done in that order one at a time as daily time allows, is attributed to consultant Ivy Lee as the most profitable advice received by Charles M. Schwab, president of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.[11][12][13]\\nAn early advocate of \"ABC\" prioritization was Alan Lakein, in 1973. In his system \"A\" items were the most important (\"A-1\" the most important within that group), \"B\" next most important, \"C\" least important.[14]\\nTo prioritize a daily task list, one either records the tasks in the order of highest priority, or assigns them a number after they are listed (\"1\" for highest priority, \"2\" for second highest priority, etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.[15]\\nVarious writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following.\\n\\nTo remain flexible, a task system must allow for unforeseen circumstances.[16]\\nTo avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern, the task system should also include regular (monthly, semi-annual, and annual) planning and system-evaluation sessions, to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the desired direction.[17]\\nGTD (Getting Things Done)[edit]\\nThe Getting Things Done method, created by David Allen, is to finish small tasks immediately and for large tasks to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now.[18] The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they are easy to see and manage. \"The truth is, it takes more energy to keep something inside your head than outside,\" says Allen.[18][19]\\n\\nPomodoro[edit]\\nFrancesco Cirillo\\'s \"Pomodoro Technique\" was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a tomato-shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The \"Pomodoro\" is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros.[20]\\n\\nFranklin Planner[edit]\\nThe Franklin Planner is a paper-based time management system created by Hyrum W. Smith and named after Benjamin Franklin, which gained widespread popularity during the 1980s and 1990s. The methodology emphasizes connecting daily tasks to long-term goals and personal values, promoting the concept of \"beginning with the end in mind\" to ensure that daily activities align with larger life purposes. The system utilizes a ring-binder format planner containing specialized pages for daily planning, monthly and weekly calendars, goal-setting worksheets, and values clarification exercises. Its distinctive feature is the ABC priority system combined with numerical rankings (A1, A2, B1, etc.) for task prioritization, where A represents vital tasks, B important ones, and C nice-to-do items.\\n\\nEisenhower method[edit]\\nSee also: PICK chart and MoSCoW method\\nA basic Eisenhower box to help evaluate urgency and importance. Items may be placed at more precise points within each quadrant.\\nThe Eisenhower method or Eisenhower principle is a method that utilizes the principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: \"I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.\"[21] Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to an unnamed \"former college president.\"[22]\\nUsing the Eisenhower decision principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent,[23] and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower matrix. Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows.\\n\\nImportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally\\nImportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done personally\\nUnimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated\\nUnimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped\\nRelated concepts[edit]\\nTime management is related to the following concepts.\\n\\nReturn on time invested: Effective time management is essential for maximizing Return on Time Invested (ROTI). By prioritizing tasks and organizing schedules, individuals can ensure that time is allocated to activities yielding the highest value.\\nProject management: Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as project planning and project scheduling. Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management.[24]\\nAttention management relates to the management of cognitive resources, and in particular, the time that humans allocate their mind (and organize the minds of their employees) to conduct some activities.\\nTimeblocking is a time management strategy that specifically advocates for allocating chunks of time to dedicated tasks in order to promote deeper focus and productivity.\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nAttention management\\nChronemics\\nGoal setting\\nInterruption science\\nOrder\\nProcrastination\\nProfessional organizing\\nProject management\\nProspective memory\\nPunctuality\\nScientific management\\nTask management\\nTime perception\\nTime-tracking software\\nWaiting period\\nWorkforce management\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"TIME MANAGEMENT | Definition\".\\n\\n^ Stella Cottrell (2013).

One of the biggest challenges posed by the rapid migration of inhabitants into cities is increased air pollution. Sustainable Development Goal 11 indicates that 99 percent of the world’s urban population breathes polluted air. In such a trend of urbanization, predicting the concentrations of pollutants in advance is very important. Predictions of pollutants would help city administrations to take timely measures for ensuring Sustainable Development Goal 11. In data engineering, imputation and the removal of outliers are very important steps prior to forecasting the concentration of air pollutants. For pollution and meteorological data, missing values and outliers are critical problems that need to be addressed. This paper proposes a novel method called multiple iterative imputation using autoencoder-based long short-term memory (MIA-LSTM) which uses iterative imputation using an extra tree regressor as an estimator for the missing values in multivariate data followed by an LSTM autoencoder for the detection and removal of outliers present in the dataset. The preprocessed data were given to a multivariate LSTM for forecasting PM2.5 concentration. This paper also presents the effect of removing outliers and missing values from the dataset as well as the effect of imputing missing values in the process of forecasting the concentrations of air pollutants. The proposed method provides better results for forecasting with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 9.8883. The obtained results were compared with the traditional gated recurrent unit (GRU), 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) approaches for a dataset of the Aotizhonhxin area of Beijing in China. Similar results were observed for another two locations in China and one location in India. The results obtained show that imputation and outlier/anomaly removal improve the accuracy of air pollution forecasting.', 'title': 'Novel MIA-LSTM Deep Learning Hybrid Model with Data Preprocessing for Forecasting of PM2.5', 'source': 'sample.pdf', 'total_pages': 20, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}, page_content='Citation: Narkhede, G.; Hiwale, A.;\\nTidke, B.; Khadse, C.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitro-\\ngen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur\\ndioxide (SO2), and hydrocarbons (HC) are the major pollutants responsible for pollution.\\nInformation about these pollutants was gathered with the help of an ambient information\\nsystem [3]. Due to the small size of pollutants, ﬁne particulates (particulate matter with an\\naerodynamic diameter <2.5 mm; PM2.5) can inﬁltrate the respiratory system’s bronchioles\\nand alveolar region as well as migrate into blood vessels [4]. PM10 and PM2.5 are the most\\ndangerous contaminants. Their pollution levels can be used by government organiza-\\ntions and authorities to take preventative measures and necessary action to control and\\ndecrease pollution. Predicting PM 2.5 and PM10 concentrations could be of great help to\\nadministrations in mitigating the negative consequences of these pollutants. As a result,\\nnew approaches for estimating PM 2.5 and PM10 concentrations are always required to\\nbe searched for by researchers. Quality of air and weather are inextricably linked with\\nmeteorological elements, such as air pressure, humidity, temperature, cloud coverage, wind\\nspeed, wind direction, and precipitation, having a signiﬁcant impact on air quality fore-\\ncasting. The latest artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques are used for forecasting air quality.\\nMoreover, due to increased computational power, many researchers have focused on deep\\nlearning techniques in various areas such as image analytics, video analytics, sequential\\nmodeling, and data analysis using data-driven models [5].

Missing data are\\na signiﬁcant problem in several scientiﬁc ﬁelds, especially environmental research [10].\\nMany univariate methods, such as nearest neighbor imputation, linear imputation,\\nand spline imputation, along with multivariate methods, such as self-organizing map\\nimputation, multilayer perceptron imputation, regression-based imputation, and multivari-\\nate nearest neighbor imputation, as well as hybrid methods containing combinations of\\nimputation methods were compared and evaluated, which shows that certain multivariate\\nmethods for imputation are better choices [ 11]. Several factors including the pattern of\\nmissing data and the type of missing data inﬂuence the appropriate technique for dealing\\nwith missing data. Simple imputation methods include missing data imputation by either\\nmean, median of the respective column, or replacing the missing value with the proceeding\\nor succeeding value. The authors in [12] interpolated missing values in environmentally\\ncontaminated datasets using a single imputation method termed the site-dependent effect\\nmethod (SDEM) which provides superior imputation than row-mean imputation. The\\nmissing values can be imputed using various regression models, such as multiple linear\\nregression or artiﬁcial neural network techniques. In [ 13], it was concluded that for air\\npollution prediction, the ANN method performed better than the simple regression method,\\nwhich provides intuition regarding the use of ANN techniques such as iterative imputation.\\nThe vector autoregressive imputation technique (VAR-IM) is a novel approach for\\nimputing missing values in multivariate time series datasets that improves speed and\\naccuracy [ 14]. If the percentage of missing data is fairly minimal, VAR-IM does not\\nhave priority for imputation (less than 10 percent). Out of the various methods used for\\nimputation, singular value decomposition (SVD), the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method,\\nand the sequential k-nearest neighbor (SKNN) method provide better imputation accuracy\\nfor air pollution datasets [15]. In a comprehensive literature survey performed on missing\\ndata, it was determined that both the miss forest (iterative imputation method) and k\\nnearest neighbor methods can handle missing values successfully [16]. The missing values\\nwere replaced with a linear interpolation method in the preprocessing stage, and then\\nmultiple pollutants were predicted using the MS-TCN model, which performed better\\ncompared to other baseline models [17]. The state-of-the-art method to impute multivariate\\ndata via chained equations [18] and iterative imputation, miss forest, and deep learning\\napproaches [19,20] was used to impute missing data in air quality datasets. In order to deal\\nwith missing data in the air quality datasets, multiple data mining techniques [ 21,22] as\\nwell as statistical techniques [23,24] were implemented for appropriate imputation. The\\nmissing values were found by building a model based on a complete instance of the dataset\\nexcluding missing values; the nonparametric iterative imputation algorithm (NIIA) method\\nas an extension to the solution of imputation using incomplete instances of the dataset\\nwas proposed [25]. Ref. [ 15] compared six imputation models and showed that various\\nKNN imputation methods were superior to simple imputation techniques, such as mean or\\nmedian imputation techniques. A hybrid imputation method proposed in [26], called KI, is\\na combination of KNN and iterative imputation and obtained good results compred to a\\nsimple KNN method. For NOx prediction, an LSSVM-based iteration strategy was utilized,\\nwhich improved the accuracy of pollutant prediction while reducing time complexity and\\nensuring prediction speed and accuracy [27]. The missing values in the simple LSTM model\\nwere ﬁlled up by zeros, and the author proposed another LSTM model where the missing\\nvalues were interpolated by Akima’s interpolation [28].

Outliers, Anomalies, and Forecasting\\nMultidimensional pollutant data and meteorological data consist of multivariate data\\nwhich is collected in chronological order from monitoring stations at a particular interval\\nof time. This data has various complications such as dimensional explosions, periodic\\ntrends, etc. Due to these problems, simple outlier removal methods result in poor spotting\\nof outliers. Hence, there is a need to remove these outliers/anomalies from the dataset\\nbefore prediction. There are two types of anomalies in air pollution datasets: unwanted\\ndata and others depending on the event of interest. Unwanted data are cleaned by using\\nsimple outlier removal methods, such as the inter quartile range, z-score, Grubb’s test,\\nTietjen–Moore test, and Hampel’s test methods [32]. In later cases, outliers/anomalies have\\nbeen removed by machine learning-based models, such as KNN, ARIMA, and SVM [33],\\nand deep learning models, such as variational models based on autoencoders [ 34] and\\nLSTM autoencoders [35]. Detecting anomalies using a combination of the robust projection\\npursuit and Mahalanobis distance method implemented in [ 36] showed that anomaly\\ndetection is important. Before removing the anomalies in the dataset, the missing values\\nwere replaced by a simple column median calculated from available data.\\n2.3. Modern Methods Used for Forecasting\\nFor the time series data prediction problem, the existing work [37] that uses machine\\nlearning methods, such as ANN, does not remember the recurrent past data. However,\\nit is very important to consider past data in time series forecasting. In recent times, time\\nseries data RNNs have gained a lot of attention; it is one of the classes of artiﬁcial neural\\nnetworks (ANNs). The ﬁrst architecture to reveal the hidden structure of data was the\\nElman RNN [38] where a simple RNN uses BPNN (back propagation through time). This\\nRNN outperforms simple ANNs with feed-forward networks for data that are dynamic\\nin nature [39]. Strength and limitations of forecasting techniques by in various research\\npapers are summarized in Table 1.\\nThere are some limitations of RNNs too, as it is incapable of remembering long-\\nterm signiﬁcant important data. Further, whenever there are long-term dependencies,\\nBPNN experiences exploding and vanishing gradient problems.

Iterative Imputation Using Extra Tree Regressor\\nThe iterative imputation method was used for replacing missing data in the available\\ndataset, where every feature was modeled as a function of other remaining features. The\\nfunction/model was created with the help of various regressors available. In this process,\\nthe missing values were identiﬁed using the regressor model and repeated with multiple\\niterations. This was performed in order to get a more accurate value of the missing data. As\\nmany iterations were performed, this process is called iterative imputation. Here, the rows\\nand columns where the missing values were present were identiﬁed, and the respective\\nrows were removed. This created two datasets: one which did not contain missing values\\nand the other that contained missing values. The target was to replace these missing values.\\nUsing the ﬁrst set of data and applying the machine learning regression algorithm, the\\nmissing values from the later set could be identiﬁed. In this paper, during imputation,\\nan extra tree regressor was used to ﬁnd the missing values. For the same dataset, the\\nexperimentation was carried out for the prediction of particulate matter by using various\\nregression techniques, such as LightGBM, gradient boosting regressor, KNN, decision tree,\\nextra tree, and thirteen more. Out of these techniques, extra tree regressor provided the\\nleast RMSE and MAE values for prediction. Hence, the ET regressor was chosen as an\\nestimator in the iterative imputation. This was the ﬁrst iteration; after imputation, the\\ndataset was merged, and after merging the dataset, the regression was applied to obtain\\nthe new imputed values. Iterations were carried out until the difference in the imputed\\nvalues was the least, as shown in the ﬂowchart.\\n3.3. Anomaly Detection and Removal\\nAutoencoders have architectural designs such as feed-forward artiﬁcial neural net-\\nworks. Here, one of the hidden layers is a code layer, which has fewer nodes for dimen-\\nsionality reduction that can be selected by the user. The encoder performs dimensionality\\nreduction whereas the job of the decoder is to get the same output as input (the decoder is\\na replica image of the encoder).\\nAutoencoders consist of a decoder and encoder in the output and input layer. When\\nboth the encoder and decoder are LSTM modules, then these types of autoencoders are\\nsaid to be an autoencoder LSTM. Thus, LSTM autoencoders use encoder–decoder LSTM'),\n",

The preprocessed data were given to a multivariate LSTM for forecasting PM2.5 concentration. This paper also presents the effect of removing outliers and missing values from the dataset as well as the effect of imputing missing values in the process of forecasting the concentrations of air pollutants. The proposed method provides better results for forecasting with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 9.8883. The obtained results were compared with the traditional gated recurrent unit (GRU), 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) approaches for a dataset of the Aotizhonhxin area of Beijing in China. Similar results were observed for another two locations in China and one location in India. The results obtained show that imputation and outlier/anomaly removal improve the accuracy of air pollution forecasting.', 'title': 'Novel MIA-LSTM Deep Learning Hybrid Model with Data Preprocessing for Forecasting of PM2.5', 'source': 'sample.pdf', 'total_pages': 20, 'page': 16, 'page_label': '17'}, page_content='Algorithms 2023, 16, 52 17 of 20\\nThe results obtained show that the proposed MIA-LSTM model obtains the best\\nresult with greatly smaller values of RMSE and MAE in all four graphs. The proposed\\nmodel performs better, obtaining the smallest value of MAE in all cities from two different\\ncountries. This validates that there is a need for data preprocessing prior to applying\\nforecasting methods.\\n6. Conclusions and Future Scope\\nResearchers and scientists have developed good models for forecasting air pollution by\\nusing various state-of-the-art methods. From the experimental analysis, it is concluded that\\nreal-world datasets contain noisy data, and to achieve reliable and accurate forecasting of air\\npollution, handling of the missing data, outlier detection and removal, and preprocessing\\nsteps are of utmost importance. In this paper, these issues are addressed by using powerful\\ndata preprocessing steps.\\nSimilarly, effective evaluation measures, i.e., RMSE, MAE, and R2, are used to compare\\nand evaluate various prediction models on different datasets. The results show that the ET\\nregressor outperforms other regressors, such as RF, LGBM, GB, and DT, for PM2.5 prediction.\\nThe ET regressor was wisely chosen based on the experimentations for iterative imputation,\\nas demonstrated in Table 3. Different models, such as univariate LSTM, univariate 1D\\nCNN, univariate GRU, and multivariate LSTM, were used for forecasting the hourly value\\nof PM2.5. All these models were used in three cases: ﬁrstly, with raw data where all missing\\nvalues were removed; secondly, with imputation; and ﬁnally, with the removal of anomalies.\\nThe proposed forecasting model, i.e., MIA-LSTM, is efﬁcient and effective in predicting\\nPM2.5 concentration with the smallest error for noisy data. The proposed model shows\\nreduced RMSE and MAE values for all the datasets used, as shown in Table 4.\\nIn the future, the existing work can be extended in the following ways:\\n• Datasets from different locations with different pollutant concentrations can be har-\\nnessed to understand the behavior of air pollution in those particular locations.\\n• The time complexity is one of the important parameters for forecasting models. Re-\\nducing the time complexity without affecting the accuracy of the forecasting can be\\none of the key aspects of the proposed work.\\n• More complex models and algorithms, such as an ensemble and CNN-LSTM, can be\\nutilized to further improve the accuracy of air pollution forecasting.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.N.; methodology, G.N.; validation, G.N., A.H. and C.K.;\\nformal analysis, B.T.; software, B.T.; writing—original draft preparation, G.N.; writing—review and\\nediting, A.H. and C.K.; supervision, A.H.
